Give the player some customization over what the character starts with, as opposed to always having 100 health and 100 mana.

This is done via a menu shown after creating a character. The menu will let you choose two affixes to imbue upon a starter accessory item. This item could be permanent, I'm not sure about that aspect of it yet. But certainly I don't want someone to make a bunch of new chars and taking these items off of them, so some method will be implemented to prevent the starter items from being traded with other players.

Also, once this feature is implemented, I'm sure we'll see that some affixes need to be tweaked in terms of balancing. I think the actual affix power on the starter item will be twice the usual amount. For instance, the highest HP affix is +40 HP. So, if you select HP affix for your starter item, it will give +80 HP.

Regarding the health and mana, the base amount will need to be reduced, to maybe 20 HP and 0 MP. I'm sure these values may need to be tweaked as well.

If a player decides not to start with mana, then in order for them to use any magic, they will have to rely on +MP affixes to do so. Is this a negative? It might not be. This could mean that players of different 'classes' and playstyles may rely on different affixes, which results in a great diversity in character builds (essentially composed of their equipment). Character diversity is always a huge plus.

Possible affixes (double the max):
+80 HP
+80 MP
+8 Defense
+10% Damage
+10% Melee Speed
+20% Magic Crit Chance
+20% Melee Crit Chance
+20% Ranged Crit Chance
+20% Magic Damage
+20% Melee Damage
+20% Ranged Damage
+100 HP On Respawn
+40% Magic Find
+20% Mining Speed
+40% Spawn Rate
-10% Mana Cost
+4 Health Regen
Reduced potion cooldown by 10 seconds
+4 Increased Block Placement Range

Another idea is to balance it by requiring a negative affix. For instance, the player might have 20% less HP, but get +10% damage.

These affixes should be permanent effects on the char. It might be possible to implement them as permanent buffs/debuffs.

Player has to chose one negative affix:
-20% HP
-20% MP
-8 Defense - Won't make your defense negative, but would make it stay at zero until you get enough.
-10% Damage
-10% Melee Speed
-20% Magic Crit Chance
-20% Melee Crit Chance
-20% Ranged Crit Chance
-20% Magic Damage
-20% Melee Damage
-20% Ranged Damage
-50% HP On Respawn - You simply start with half the health you normally would
+10% Mana Cost
-4 Health Regen
Increased potion cooldown by 10 seconds
-4 Decreased Block Placement Range
